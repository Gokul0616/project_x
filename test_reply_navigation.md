# Reply Tweet Navigation Fix - Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When clicking on reply tweets in the detail screen, they weren't opening their own detail screens.

**Root Cause**: `ReplyTweetCard` was disabled when `isInDetailScreen: true` was passed.

## ðŸ”§ Fix Applied

### 1. Enabled Reply Navigation in Detail Screens
**File**: `/app/lib/widgets/reply_tweet_card.dart`

**Before:**
```dart
onTap: isInDetailScreen ? null : () {
  // Only navigate if not already in detail screen
  Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => TweetDetailScreen(tweet: tweet),
  ));
},
```

**After:**
```dart
onTap: () {
  // Always allow navigation to tweet detail screen
  // Each reply tweet should open its own detail screen
  Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => TweetDetailScreen(tweet: tweet),
  ));
},
```

### 2. Updated TweetDetailScreen Usage
**File**: `/app/lib/screens/tweet/tweet_detail_screen.dart`

**Before:**
```dart
ReplyTweetCard(
  tweet: displayReplies[index],
  showParent: false,
  isInDetailScreen: true, // Prevent double navigation
);
```

**After:**
```dart
ReplyTweetCard(
  tweet: displayReplies[index],
  showParent: false,
  isInDetailScreen: false, // Allow navigation to reply detail screens
);
```
