# Call Functionality Fix - Implementation Summary

## Original Problem
- User reported "Failed to start video call" and "Failed to start voice call" errors
- Calling feature didn't actually connect opponents
- Need real calling notifications for offline users
- Need actual real calling features

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Fixes
- ✅ Fixed server startup issues (removed SSL requirement for development)
- ✅ Fixed MongoDB connection handling (graceful fallback)
- ✅ Added WebRTC signaling handlers in socketService.js
- ✅ Updated API port configuration (3000)
- ✅ Made io object available to routes

### 2. Frontend CallService Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `_getCurrentUserId()` method to properly get user ID from auth
- ✅ Added proper socket authentication with JWT token  
- ✅ Updated WebRTC signaling to use API endpoints instead of raw socket events
- ✅ Added proper error handling for call initiation
- ✅ Implemented WebRTC offer/answer/ICE candidate handling
- ✅ Added `rejectCall()` method for declining calls

### 3. API Configuration Fixes
- ✅ Updated API base URL to match backend port (3000)
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint paths (removed duplicate '/api' prefix)

### 4. Notification System
- ✅ Enhanced NotificationService with incoming call notifications
- ✅ Added call action handlers (accept/decline buttons in notifications)
- ✅ Integrated notification cancellation when calls end
- ✅ Added proper call notification categories for Android/iOS

### 5. App Initialization
- ✅ Updated main.dart to properly initialize CallService
- ✅ Added error handling for CallService initialization
- ✅ Made CallService available via provider pattern

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Call Initiation**: When user clicks call/video buttons, it should:
   - Create call via API (/api/calls/start)
   - Generate WebRTC offer
   - Send offer to recipient
   - Show "Calling..." state

2. **Incoming Calls**: When receiving a call:
   - Show full-screen notification (Android) or critical alert (iOS)
   - Display caller name and call type
   - Provide Accept/Decline action buttons
   - Ring until answered or declined

3. **Call Connection**: When call is accepted:
   - Exchange WebRTC offer/answer via API
   - Establish peer-to-peer audio/video connection
   - Show call controls (mute, speaker, camera toggle, etc.)

## Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Call Initiation
```bash
# Backend should be running on port 3000
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","message":"Twitter Clone Backend API is running"}
```

### Test 2: Authentication Required
```bash
# Test call API without token (should fail gracefully)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/calls/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"recipientId": "test", "callType": "voice"}'
# Should return: {"message":"Token is not valid"}
```

### Test 3: App Testing
1. Start the Flutter app
2. Login with valid credentials  
3. Navigate to a chat/conversation
4. Click the call or video call button
5. Should NOT show "Failed to start call" error
6. Should show "Calling..." state

## Remaining Issues to Fix
- [ ] Database connection (MongoDB) - currently running without DB
- [ ] User authentication flow needs to be tested
- [ ] Call permissions (microphone/camera) handling
- [ ] Push notifications for completely offline users

## Files Modified
- `/app/backend/server.js` - Fixed server startup and WebRTC support
- `/app/backend/services/socketService.js` - Added WebRTC signaling
- `/app/lib/services/call_service.dart` - Major overhaul for proper WebRTC
- `/app/lib/services/notification_service.dart` - Enhanced call notifications
- `/app/lib/config/api_config.dart` - Fixed API URLs
- `/app/lib/main.dart` - Proper CallService initialization

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Test backend health endpoint ✅
2. Test Flutter app compilation and startup
3. Test authentication flow
4. Test call initiation (should not show "Failed to start call")
5. Test incoming call notifications
6. Test WebRTC connection establishment
